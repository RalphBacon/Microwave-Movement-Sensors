# Microwave-Movement-Sensors
Two microwave movement sensors head-to-head. Any better than a PIR? See video #78 here: https://www.youtube.com/c/RalphBacon

Two µwave movement sensors go head-to-head, the HB100 and the XYC-WB-DC. Both operate using µwaves but give very different results.

Microwaves can see through doors and walls but is this what you need in a movement detector? And are they better than the ubiquitous PIR sensor? We'll see in the video.

The good thing is that at least one of these devices costs (a lot) less than a cup of barista-made coffee so it's worth just experimenting so see how it might fit in your next project.

Added to the fact that documentation on these devices is a bit sparse (and especially how we might connect them to an Arduino) it was fun trying to get these working as you might want them to work. Was I successful? Well, the video reveals all!
